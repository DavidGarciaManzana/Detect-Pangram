# Detect_Pangram



In the world of letters and words, there was a peculiar puzzle that had captivated the minds of many. This puzzle was known as a pangram, a sentence that contained every single letter of the alphabet at least once. The challenge was to detect whether a given sentence was a pangram or not, and to do so with precision and accuracy.

The rules were simple yet crucial. The sentence had to be checked for its alphabetical content, ignoring any numbers and punctuation that may be present. Additionally, the case of the letters was irrelevant, meaning that both upper and lowercase letters were to be considered as the same.

Many tried their hand at solving this puzzle, but only a select few were able to master it. These individuals were known as the Pangram Detectives, and they were highly regarded in the world of letters. Their expertise lay in their ability to quickly and efficiently determine whether a sentence was a pangram or not.

The test remains straightforward. If the sentence contains all 26 letters of the alphabet, at least once, it is considered a pangram, and the result must be returned as True. Otherwise, the result must be False.

So, the challenge was set. Could you become a Pangram Detective and solve the mystery of the pangrams? The world of letters was waiting for your answer.
